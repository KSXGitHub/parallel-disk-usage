Highly parallelized, blazing fast directory tree analyzer.

## Description

`pdu` is a CLI program that renders a graphical chart for disk usages of files and directories, it is an alternative to [`dust`](https://github.com/bootandy/dust) and [`dutree`](https://github.com/nachoparker/dutree).

## Benchmark

The benchmark was generated by [a GitHub Workflow](https://github.com/KSXGitHub/parallel-disk-usage/blob/0.5.2/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml#L476-L658) and uploaded to the release page.

## Features

* Fast.
* Relative comparison of separate files.
* Extensible via the library crate or JSON interface.
* Optional progress report.
* Customize tree depth.
* Customize chart size.

## Limitations

* Ignorant of hard links: All hard links are counted as real files.
* Do not follow symbolic links.
* Do not differentiate filesystem: Mounted folders are counted as normal folders.
* The runtime is optimized at the expense of binary size.

## Development

### Prerequisites

* [`cargo`](github.com/rust-lang/cargo)

### Test

```sh
./test.sh && ./test.sh --release
```

</details>

### Run

```sh
./run pdu "${arguments[@]}"
```

* `"${arguments[@]}"`: List of arguments to pass to `pdu`.

### Build

#### Debug build

```sh
cargo build --bin pdu
```

The resulting executable is located at `target/debug/pdu`.

#### Release build

```sh
cargo build --bin pdu --release
```

The resulting executable is located at `target/release/pdu`.

### Update shell completion files

```sh
./generate-completions.sh
```

## Extending `parallel-disk-usage`

The [parallel-disk-usage crate](https://crates.io/crates/parallel-disk-usage) is both a binary crate and a library crate. If you desire features that `pdu` itself lacks (that is, after you have asked the maintainer(s) of `pdu` for the features but they refused), you may use the library crate to build a tool of your own. The documentation for the library crate can be found in [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/parallel-disk-usage).

Alternatively, the `pdu` command provides `--json-input` flag and `--json-output` flag. The `--json-output` flag converts disk usage data into JSON and the `--json-input` flag turns said JSON into visualization. These 2 flags allow integration with other CLI tools (via pipe, as per the UNIX philosophy).

Beware that the structure of the JSON tree differs depends on the number of file/directory names that were provided (as CLI arguments):
* If there are only 0 or 1 file/directory names, the name of the tree root would be a real path (either `.` or the provided name).
* If there are 2 or more file/directory names, the name of the tree root would be `(total)` (which is not a real path), and the provided names would correspond to the children of the tree root.
